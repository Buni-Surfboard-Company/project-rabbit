    <h2 class="text-primary">Shipping Limitation</h2>
    <p>
      When an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by
      you as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping
      restrictions contained on the Site. All purchases from the Site are made
      pursuant to shipment conditions, by accepting these terms and conditions
      through your use of the Site. You are responsible for contacting BUNI
      BOARDS Customer Service regarding any claims for damaged and/or lost
      shipments as well as changes to any shipment information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-primary">Email Communication</h2>
    <p>
      By making a purchase on the Site or otherwise creating an account on the
      Site, you understand that we may send you communications or data regarding
      our products and services. You agree to receive such communications from
      us. Unless such email is necessary to facilitate a transaction, such as to
      complete a sale or provide you with information related to a purchase, we
      will give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these commercial
      emails from us by following the opt-out instructions provided in such
      message(s).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-primary">Confirmation of Orders</h2>
    <p>
      While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an
      email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order.
      We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on
      any product and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require
      verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any
      order.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-primary">Cancellation or Refusal of Orders</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our
      sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per
      household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or
      under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that
      use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event we make a
      change to or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting
      the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the
      order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in
      our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or
      distributors. Please ensure your order is correct before placing it.
      Orders canceled within 72 hours of being placed will be charged a 5%
      processing fee. Surfboard orders canceled after 72 hours will be charged a
      restocking fee based on the size, construction, and how far along it is in
      production.
    </p>

      requirements that are different than those in the U.S. Merchandise
      availability on our Site is not guaranteed as it may be low in stock. If
      merchandise is not available by the time your order processes, we will
      notify you of this via e-mail. You can always verify availability by
      calling Customer Service at 1-503-739-2739. You will receive a shipping

      or liable for any claim, including, without limitation, loss or injury to
      real, tangible, or intellectual property, violations of personal privacy
      or privacy rights, actual, consequential or punitive damages, personal

    <h2 class="text-primary">Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      Mindful of the high cost of legal dispute, not only in dollars but also in
      time and energy, both you and BUNI BOARDS agree to the following
      dispute resolution procedure: In the event of any controversy, claim,
      action or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted
      on this Websites, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity
      of this Agreement or any part of it ("dispute"), the party asserting the
      dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such dispute by providing
      written notice to the other party by registered mail describing the facts
      and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the dispute,
      and allowing the receiving party 30 days from the date of mailing to
      respond to the dispute. Notice shall be sent to: BUNI BOARDS Customer
      Service, 4131 NW Walnut Pl, Corvallis, OR 97330. Unless you indicate otherwise
      in your notice, BUNI BOARDS shall respond to your notice using your
      last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your
      online profile.
      <br />
      In the event that BUNI BOARDS is unable to resolve the dispute with
      you through the Customer Service department referenced above, you and
      BUNI BOARDS both agree the parties shall resolve their dispute
      utilizing binding arbitration in the State of California. Arbitration
      shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any
      claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis. You hereby waive your
      right to a class action lawsuit.
