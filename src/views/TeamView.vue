                    No stranger to the Oregon Coast, Parker grew up in Seaside, Oregon. He is currently studying Computer Science at Oregon State
                    University, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics. Despite Parker's calling to servitude of the screen, his heart
                    belongs to the ocean and all of the intricacies it has to offer. He understands the dichotomy that exists between surfing and nature and wishes to bridge that gap through eco-focused innovation!
                    Buni has quickly become so much more than a surfboard company to Parker.
                    He is beyond thankful for each surf-rat incidiary that makes up this collective and is blown away by the family that has been a product of it.
                    All in all, Parker wishes to share the love, therapy, and frustration surfing has so reliably provided him.

                <p>Born in Anchorage, Alaska and raised by rabid wolves, Mason is no stranger to danger. Growing up the young lad spent his summers in 
                    Arch Cape, Oregon longing for Pacific swells and an escape from the snow storms of the north. He moved to Arch Cape at 13 and 
                    found an affinity for board sports. His first passion was shredding the concrete tides on four wheels and an 8.75 plank, but fell in
                     love with surfing after learning the hard way that water is more welcoming than asphalt. Currently a Psychology student at 
                     Oregon State University, Mason plans to bring awareness to the psychological struggles all humans experience and find new ways to
                      improve the lives of those in need. The young man may be accident prone, but his perseverance and love for sharing froth will ensure that anyone interested in surfing will be graciously adopted into this cult of stoke.
                     (Also, he is the best fur father to the cutest rescue dog. Soon enough he will have Asta the mutt pup on a board cheating a 5!)</p>

                <p>New York City born and raised, Frederick grew up surfing the golden beaches of Flying Point, Long Island. Frustrated with his access to 
                    raw nature in the Big Apple, Frederick made his way to Deerfield, Massachusetts for high school, and eventually followed his heart 
                    and family to Central Oregon. Currently studying mechanical engineering at Oregon State University, Frederick has found a calling in composites research and manufacturing. When he isn't making carbon-fiber car parts, you will find him laying pristine sheets of fiberglass on hand shaped surfboards. Side note: If you ever run into Frederick make sure to ask him about Buni sustainability, as it is his goal of focus for the company!</p>

                    Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) was the founder of American pragmatism (after about 1905 called by Peirce “pragmaticism” in order to differentiate his views from those of William James, John Dewey, and others, which were being labelled “pragmatism”), a theorist of logic, language, communication, and the general theory of signs (which was often called by Peirce “semeiotic”), an extraordinarily prolific logician (mathematical and general), and a developer of an evolutionary, psycho-physically monistic metaphysical system. Practicing geodesy and chemistry in order to earn a living, he nevertheless considered scientific philosophy, and especially logic, to be his true calling, his real vocation.

                <p>Garner has not yet provided a biography, so here is one from a 19th century philosopher: <br/> <br/>
                    Arthur Schopenhauer was among the first 19th century philosophers to contend that at its core, the universe is not a rational place. Inspired by Plato and Kant, both of whom regarded the world as being more amenable to reason, Schopenhauer developed their philosophies into an instinct-recognizing and ultimately ascetic outlook, emphasizing that in the face of a world filled with endless strife, we ought to minimize our natural desires for the sake of achieving a more tranquil frame of mind and a disposition towards universal beneficence. Often considered to be a thoroughgoing pessimist, Schopenhauer in fact advocated ways – via artistic, moral and ascetic forms of awareness – to overcome a frustration-filled and fundamentally painful human condition.

            <p> Since the day I received my first surfboard, I’ve had only two things on my mind: 

waves, and the equipment we use to ride them. 

Born and raised in Astoria, on the Northern Oregon coast, I didn’t begin surfing until I moved to Kaua’i at 19 years old. While on Kaua’i I became fascinated with surfing and surfboard design. I have always been crafty and artistic, and realized that making surfboards would be the ultimate manifestation of surf and my creative tendencies. Since that moment, I’ve spent every waking minute soaking up every ounce of board design knowledge I could take, and have found incredible fulfillment in building crafts that allow people to enjoy the seas.</p>

Aaron started surfing on the oregon coast at 12 and immediately fell in love with it. He took whatever chance he could to paddle out, and got lucky enough to finish his last two years of high school in Southern California, where he would surf every day after school. He now lives in San Francisco where the water is a lot colder but the waves are just as good. He’s currently finishing his degree in architecture and enjoys combining his love for surfing and design.

                    William James was an original thinker in and between the disciplines of physiology, psychology and philosophy. His twelve-hundred page masterwork, The Principles of Psychology (1890), is a rich blend of physiology, psychology, philosophy, and personal reflection that has given us such ideas as “the stream of thought” and the baby’s impression of the world “as one great blooming, buzzing confusion” (PP 462). It contains seeds of pragmatism and phenomenology, and influenced generations of thinkers in Europe and America, including Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. James studied at Harvard’s Lawrence Scientific School and the School of Medicine, but his writings were from the outset as much philosophical as scientific.
