        "content": "Today I saw an older man trip on his shoelace and introduce his face to the pavement in a crowded intersection. We all continued with our left-right, left-right dance to nameless destinations. Most of us directed our attention to little palm sized portals in an effort to turn the other cheek to the painful display of humanity we just witnessed. I would imagine we were all on the same handful of apps. They contain endless thumb twitches; algorithms learning from the taps, pauses, and clicks to feed us more of that sweet pixelated morphine. I would assume that the old man got wheeled away in a screeching truck that fed him the morphine he needed.<br><br> What if someone in that intersection had been reading something with any real concern for humanity? What if instead of thumbs sliding on screens they were daydreaming of sliding down liquid glass? What if the inertia of their steps was actually reflected in what they held in their palm? Would the old man still have an all too personal encounter with the asphalt? Probably. But maybe… possibly… someone would have knelt over him and offered a second of human comfort to distract from his horrors. Maybe that second of humanity could be put into words, or a sketch or, a rambling thought such as this one. A piece of blue light that actually offers connection to each other and the world we have found ourselves wandering through. That’s what I want this to be. Maybe a few people will read it, maybe hundreds, likely none, but at the very least it offers an opportunity for each of us to reflect and create. There’s not much else for us to do here, and this is an opportunity for each of us as friends, co-shapers, and people to gain understanding of what surfing and the world around us means to each of us. Maybe someone else gets something out of it as well and that is a lovely thought. Write what you want, go on tangents as you please, piss on any conventions of what should or shouldn’t be said, and most importantly understand that this was all hypothetical as I did not actually walk right by a poor old man. I like to think I would have helped.",
