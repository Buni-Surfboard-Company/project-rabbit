        "content": "Today I saw an older man trip on his shoelace and introduce his face to the pavement in a crowded intersection. We all continued with our left-right, left-right dance to nameless destinations. Most of us directed our attention to little palm sized portals in an effort to turn the other cheek to the painful display of humanity we just witnessed. I would imagine we were all on the same handful of apps. They contain endless thumb twitches; algorithms learning from the taps, pauses, and clicks to feed us more of that sweet pixelated morphine. I would assume that the old man got wheeled away in a screeching truck that fed him the morphine he needed.<br><br>What if someone in that intersection had been reading something with any real concern for humanity? What if instead of thumbs sliding on screens they were daydreaming of sliding down liquid glass? What if the inertia of their steps was actually reflected in what they held in their palm? Would the old man still have an all too personal encounter with the asphalt? Probably. But maybe… possibly… someone would have knelt over him and offered a second of human comfort to distract from his horrors. Maybe that second of humanity could be put into words, or a sketch or, a rambling thought such as this one. A piece of blue light that actually offers connection to each other and the world we have found ourselves wandering through. That’s what I would like for this to be. Maybe a few people will read it, maybe hundreds, likely none, but at the very least it offers an opportunity for each of us to reflect and create. There’s not much else for us to do here, and this is an opportunity for each of us as friends, co-shapers, and people to gain understanding of what surfing and the world around us means to each of us. Maybe someone else gets something out of it as well and that is a lovely thought. Write what you want, go on tangents as you please, piss on any conventions of what should or shouldn’t be said, and most importantly understand that this was all hypothetical as I did not actually walk right by a poor old man.<br><br>I like to think I would have helped.",

        "content": "Mt. Hood Highway, 8:38 am. 23 degrees of the Fahrenheit variety. Several feet of snow in the last 48 hours, combined with the malnourished bank account of the Oregon Dept. of Transportation meant neglected and rather treacherous roadways. About 4 miles from the parking lot of our destination and taking up about 60% of the road, lay a 1990s Ford F-Series pick up truck. The truck was accompanied by a young lady attempting to navigate the perfidious territory of faulty four-wheel drive. There’s a colloquial vernacular that goes to the tune of “kicking the tires.” Idiomatically speaking, it has nothing to do with this particular situation, the lady was just, quite literally, kicking her tires. And you know what was messed up? The fellow motorists couldn’t care less! Speeding on by, often within feet of the woman, they appeared to be more concerned with beating the lift line than the well being of a whole person. Where was the humanity? <br/><br/>Streetcar stop #8989, Portland. 8:45 pm. Pouring rain and cold enough to not want to take your hands out of your pockets. The streetcar is running 8 minutes late, oh well. A few strides south of the transit shelter I found myself at, was an older gentleman who carried with him a glow of resilience. This man was in a wheelchair, attempting to cross an intersection but was met with resistance due to some trivial municipal planning and maintenance (an unnecessarily high sidewalk curb). He was asking for help crossing. By the reaction, or perhaps unresponsiveness, of the many passersby, one might think this man was merely spectral; nonexistent. He was not though. The man was nothing more or less than an accompanying resident of this little pale blue dot. Someone with genuine experiences that has felt love, anger, joy, sadness, things that humans feel. Why was he being ignored? Where was the humanity? <br/><br/>UCLA researchers have long researched incoming college students and what they want from life. In 1966, almost 90% of them were strongly motivated to develop a meaningful philosophy of life. This was their primary goal! By 2015, the point of school and primary goal was financial success for 82% of students. Moral Convulsion. The institution of education once was a medium of moral formation. A factory focused on churning out people that would proceed into the jaded world with respectfulness, honesty, gentleness. Now, the angst riddled halls whisper SAT scores, elite colleges, existence amidst the competition. I get it. People need to survive! It’s messed up out there. To articulate the difficulty those endure to simple scrap by would be blatantly disrespectful to the tragedies accumulating by the second. Where is the humanity?<br/><br/>Is there a point to this blog post? Yes. Things that shouldn’t have to be said. Things that people don’t consider themselves complacent within, but are. Ask the lady struggling with her truck if she needs any help. Help the man get across the street. Perpetuate compassion, empathy, love. Have some humanity. ",

        "content": "There is something to be said about balance. Yet, at this very moment I am not quite sure what it is. I think I’ll start with some super cliché examples so I can steer your thinking a little and not waste too much of your time. My list of balances goes: Black and white, good and evil, yes and no, positive and negative, happy and sad, sweet and spicy, up and down, left and right, over and under, bored and busy, life and death – the list can go on for many pages but probably not forever? I don’t know. Whatever.<br/><br/>So, balance. I find myself getting frustrated, confused, or torn quite often yet I always tend to return to a sense of peace, satisfaction, or excitement. What’s strange to me is that it feels like the first mentioned feelings always happen before the latter feelings. Which also makes sense to me - I think. I have tactics to get me through those feelings that make me feel bad, and as result I turn my thinking around. For example, I tell myself - and even friends who are struggling - things like, “The rain always stops,” “This too shall pass,” or “You cannot have the highs without the lows.” This last one I think connects well with what we’re exploring here today. Is it true? To me, yes. As a very literal person and aspiring engineer, data is very important to me. Not necessarily numbers, but examples. This is where my first list of balances can aid us. For some magical reason the perceivable universe relies heavily on pairs of opposites. Yes, I am aware that middle ground can exist, however, I’ll even challenge that with the thought; middle ground is only a summary of the two opposites coexisting. Which brings us back to balance.<br/><br/>As an almost-twenty-three-year-old, I get the pleasure (and sometimes displeasure) of making a lot of decisions for myself. Some decisions I can take back and some are much more permanent. The more permanent ones scare me – even just the thought of them. (And I say “more permanent” because I don’t have any concrete evidence of something truly permanent.) <br/><br/>These bouts of decision making often create a yearning for the aforementioned and elusive middle ground. One could say, “the best of both worlds.” (Side note: Always make me think of Hannah Montana. Always.) I’m sorry, but what other world are we talking about? And now I kind of sound like an idiot talking about the phenomena of pairs and I can’t even name the other “world” everyone’s referencing. Could the other world be no word at all? It’s got to be out there somewhere.<br/><br/> I am aware these thoughts are not profound by any means, I just I felt the need to make a written observation. If this monologue of mine is not relatable, I apologize. Also, if you are someone who has a consistent inability to find the lightness through the darkness, I hope that changes for you. I think hope is key word there too. Hope, to me, leaves possibilities on the table. The possibility of finding balance. And to those who are riding an awesome high, remember, “this too shall pass.” Finally, if all else fails, go surfing. Like really fucking try it.",
